# Lab 2: Multilingual text generation from Wikidata

This uses GF to generate texts from facts in the Wikidata fact database. 
You are given 

- an abstract syntax and an English concrete syntax, in the subdirectory grammars/
- a json dump from Wikidata, in the subdirectory data/
- a Python file that connects Wikidata with GF, in the subdirectory scripts/

Your task is to create a concrete syntax for some other language by using the 
GF RGL and evaluate the text generated by this. The steps to take are the following:

- in scripts/, run `python3 find_labels.py da > ../grammars/LabelsDan.gf`
- in grammars/, copy the beginnings of `LabelsEng.gf` to `LabelsDan.gf`, change Eng to Dan
- in grammars/, copy `NobelEng.gf` to `NobelDan.gf` and do the necessary changes
- in grammars/, start GF and `import NobelDan.gf`, to do some testing
- in grammars/ outside GF, do `gf -make NobelEng.gf NobelDan.gf`
- in scripts/, generate all texts with `python3 describe_nobel.py Dan`

The last step requires `pip3 install pgf`.

Replace da and Dan with your own language codes!

More instructions and demos are given in the lectures of the week 5-9 May 2025.

If you don't manage to install pgf, a quick way to test is, in GF,
```
 import NobelEng.gf
 rf -file="../data/trees.gft" -lines -tree | l
```
