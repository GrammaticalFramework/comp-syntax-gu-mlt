# Lab 2: Multilingual text generation from Wikidata

This uses GF to generate texts from facts in the Wikidata fact database. 
You are given 

- an abstract syntax and an English concrete syntax, in the subdirectory grammars/
- a json dump from Wikidata, in the subdirectory data/
- a Python file that connects Wikidata with GF, in the subdirectory scripts/

Your task is to create a concrete syntax for some other language by using the 
GF RGL and evaluate the text generated by this.

More instructions will be given in the lectures of the week 5-9 May 2025.
