# Lab 2: Multilingual text generation from Wikidata

This uses GF to generate texts from facts in the Wikidata fact database. 
You will be given 

- an abstract syntax,
- an English concrete syntax,
- a json dump from Wikidata
- a Python file that connects Wikidata with GF

Your task will be to create a concrete syntax for some other language by using the 
GF RGL and evaluate the text generated by this.

The listed files will be provided before the lab starts.
